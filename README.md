**Problem Identification: Consumerism in the World**

```sh
Consumerism is a global phenomenon characterised by the large-scale acquisition of goods and services, often beyond one's basic needs. This issue is becoming more important in our increasingly interconnected world where e-commerce has drastically transformed consumer behaviour. Analysing consumerism can help stakeholders such as economists and businesses understand spending patterns, identify trends, and evaluate the environmental or social impacts of consumption. Furthermore, businesses can use these insights to refine their marketing strategies.

The shift towards online shopping has amplified this trend, especially in global marketplaces like Amazon.

By focusing on consumerism as seen through the lens of Amazon's 2023 sales data, we aim to explore how modern shopping habits are shaped by technology, price sensitivity, and product variety. This analysis is important not only because of its economic implications but also because it raises ethical questions about sustainability and resource depletion in a world of increasing consumption.
```

## Dataset Selection and Relevance

For this analysis, we have selected a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lokeshparab/amazon-products-dataset?select=Amazon-Products.csv), that contains all products sold on Amazon in 2023.

```sh
This dataset is highly appropriate for exploring global consumerism because Amazon represents one of the largest online marketplaces worldwide, offering products across various categories and regions. 

Another reason for selecting this dataset is its potential to reflect global consumer patterns. Given Amazon's worldwide reach, the dataset captures consumption from a broad geographic range, making it possible to explore differences in consumerism between countries or regions.

Additionally, the dataset contains some incomplete or 'dirty' data, which presents an opportunity to engage in data cleaning and preprocessingâ€”an important part of any data analytics project.

By using this dataset, we can perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualise trends and patterns, and apply machine learning techniques to predict future consumer behaviour or optimise product recommendations.

```

## Project Approach
```sh
At the outset, we explored various aspects of daily life, brainstorming ideas that could be effectively examined through our data analysis project. After thoughtful deliberation, we settled on the topic of consumerismâ€”a subject that resonates with many and has broad societal relevance.

The next step involved sourcing an accessible dataset that would enable us to conduct the analysis in an optimal and insightful manner. Once this was achieved, we proceeded to gather the data and establish the projectâ€™s foundational framework, setting the stage for further exploration.

Following this, we undertook an initial exploratory data analysis (EDA), which yielded several intriguing insights explained within the notebook.

Finally, we embarked on the data cleaning process, ensuring that our approach was guided by the key questions we sought to address. Each decision in the cleaning process was closely aligned with these questions, ensuring coherence and relevance. We also managed missing data and ensured the consistency of the dataset, further refining it for our analysis.

## Questions we want to answer with our analysis

We want to identify a few trends related to the below questions:


>_Fitness questions:_'

1. Can we determine which product was the best-selling in 2023 within the "Diet and Nutrition" category?
2. How many and which gym products were purchased in 2023? 

>_Travel questions:_

1. How many travel items were bought in 2023, and which ones specifically?
2. Which months saw the most significant increases or decreases in sales?

>_Movies/books questions:_

1. Which films were the most popular in 2023, possibly broken down by month?
2. Which books were the most popular in 2023?

>_Luxury/beauty questions:_

1. Which luxury items were purchased the most in 2023?
2. Which discounted items were bought the most (on sale)?

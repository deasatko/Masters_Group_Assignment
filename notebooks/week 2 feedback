Mary’s Feedback:
Your group has conducted good univariate and bivariate analyses with a solid visual representation of the findings. However, while there is some connection with the previous Exploratory Data Analysis conducted, the interpretations could benefit from a bit more detail to strengthen the analysis especially in the univariate section.

You’ve identified strong and relevant hypotheses, and the statistical tests applied were appropriate for the data. That said, the interpretations of these results would be more effective with additional detail to explain the outcomes more comprehensively.

The investigation into potential correlations was thorough and very well-explained and the regression analysis was well-executed and clearly understood.

One of the highlights of your work is the excellent translation of your analytical insights into potential solutions or recommendations. You clearly demonstrated a strong transition from raw data to valuable insights, which is a commendable part of your project.
